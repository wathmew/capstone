If it took the U.S. military decades to learn how to get its soldiers to shoot to kill in combat, then what is the genesis of an equally effective, ongoing psychological conditioning campaign that has convinced thousands of Muslims living in the U.S., Europe, and around the world to join ISIS or launch attacks in the group \u2019s name?

The training programme is based in Jordan because of the country's proximity to the Syrian battlefields. From the beginning, the CIA and the Arab intelligence agencies relied on Jordanian security services to transport the weapons, many bought in bulk in the Balkans and elsewhere around Eastern Europe.
